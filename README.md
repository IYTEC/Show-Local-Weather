#   BUILD A RANDOM QUOTE MACHINE


##  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV/).

#   RULES
1.  Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
2.  Fulfill the below user stories: 
    - Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
    - I can see the weather in my current location.
    - I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
    - I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
    
### NOTE: 

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.

We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
